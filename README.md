# STACK INVADERS

This games is inspired by the classic game "Space invaders" and and also take some inspiration from "Space race" another classic game. It is a browser game and it has some additional gameplay mechanics that the original doesn't have, for example you can move up and down. The ability to move up and down allows you to move to the top of screen behind enemies allowing also to shoot them from above. The movement of your ship trys to simulate the movement in space where if you move one way you continue drafting untill you change direction. In the game you can also encounter debris from space that you have to avoid, the aliens are inmune to the debris making the game more challenging. The difficulty increase every time you kill all the enemies and another batch of enemies will appear becoming faster and faster in their movements each iteration. The enemies don't only move from side to side like in the classic they move also up and down. The player has 3 lives you can lose your lives by getting shot by an enemy, colliding with debries and also by colliding with an enemy, if you run out of lives the game is over. The main idea of the games is to kill as many enemies as you can to earn points while avoiding any damage. If you achive enoughs points you can earn nfts.
